[15:23:15] <deeksha19> !
[15:23:17] <ketank> kushal what if we miss the session??
[15:23:17] <kushal> In Open Source/FOSS world, we use IRC a lot.
[15:23:29] <pritam1122> !
[15:23:43] <kushal> But you should first make an habit of coming online, and chatting with people here.
[15:23:43] <Love_Guru_> not a question , but it would be great if we got to know about the Topic of the session well in advance!
[15:23:54] <rbajaj_> kushal, can you set the mode to +m.

[15:25:25] <anushil_> clear
[15:25:31] <vharsh> is \o or \0 equivalent to <EOF> or <EOM>? I saw some people writing it after the message, before the session began. So that\'s way up.
[15:25:31] <kushal> deeksha19, you should type ! and wait.

[15:27:06] <deeksha19> thanks
[15:27:06] <kushal> .link faq
[15:27:08] <SRvSaha> vharsh: <eof> is the universal way of doing that in IRC meetings

[15:27:18] <kushal> Please read the faq document.
[15:27:22] <kushal> next
[15:27:24] <pritam1122> will we have some interactive sessions?

[15:28:20] <kushal> In future yes.
[15:28:38] <kushal> So few more points to remember:
[15:28:49] <kushal> Always type full English words on IRC or mails.
[15:29:02] <kushal> Means no "u", it is you.
[15:29:46] <kushal> There are a few abbreviations like http://www.ircbeginner.com/ircinfo/abbreviations.html

[15:35:26] <kushal> For the first 1-2 days we will go through these communication related notes, and then we will move to next things.
[15:35:49] <kushal> Please remember this as very important, as most people fail to communicate properly.

[15:51:30] <kushal> pabitra, I also gave another link about asking smart questions.
[15:51:31] <SRvSaha> pabitra: batul is basically a bot : Technically speaking a script written in Python to automate task
[15:51:52] <kushal> pabitra,^^ everyone wants to see the code for this bot, we will share it at the end.
[15:52:09] <kushal> next
[15:52:17] <pabitra> ok got it...
[15:52:17] <punarvasu510> Hi all!

[15:53:02] <FazlurRahman> Hi kushal sir i am late
[15:53:16] <kushal> anushil_, you will learn that in the later sessions.
[15:53:22] <SRvSaha> pabitra: So Kushal has written the script and hence the bot which works as his assistance when the queue of questions comes in. When everyone keeps pressing ! ,it keeps track of that in a wueue and with every next command from kushal the queue is update
[15:53:33] <kushal> FazlurRahman, no problem, and you don\'t have to call anyone sir or madam on internet.
[15:53:43] <kushal> next

[15:54:15] <kushal> rahuldecoded__, we actually never end the training, people generally become part of dgplug through this.
[15:54:23] <kushal> rahuldecoded__, the sessions goes for 3 months.
[15:54:26] <kushal> next
[15:54:28] <srinidhi> I somehow got disconnected a few minutes ago, but no alert in xchat(I thought everyone were quiet). How to test the connection? Also making batul op seems a good move to me!

[15:54:49] <kushal> nikhil07, you will get it after the session.

[15:55:06] <ShaswataD> Kushal, What is the meaning of +1 as being used by everyone and you?
[15:55:18] <prashaant> nikhil07, you can start logging in Xchat : goto settings  > preferences >> logging
[15:55:23] <kushal> ShaswataD, just  a way to say I agree.
[15:55:28] <kushal> next
[15:55:29] <Rich99> @kushal My name is Mayank Gupta and i\'m the younger brother of Shreyank Gupta (shrink). He told me to inform you.

[15:57:33] <anushil_> when i was using fedora i was always stuck in infinite login loop
[15:57:37] <kushal> iyogeshjoshi, We think it is a better distribution for developers.

[15:57:48] <ShaswataD> +1
[15:57:51] <SpEcHiDe> !

[15:58:52] <PrashantJ> !
[15:58:55] <sayan> FazlurRahman: that would be told at the end of each session
[15:58:59] <SRvSaha> kushal: It\'s kind of logging issue due to some sort of high graphics.
[15:59:02] <kushal> FazlurRahman, before asking a question you should type ! and then wait for your turn to speak.
[15:59:07] <anushil_> if i enter my password ,it ask agian and again to enter the password
[15:59:08] <iyogeshjoshi> kushal: infinite loop, I guess when their desktop manager fails to load
[15:59:11] <prashaant> !
[15:59:22] <kushal> Use a different desktop manager :)

[15:13:33] <kushal> Generally does not iirc.

[15:14:29] <rtnpro> vharsh, it\'s usually helpful in answering to mails inline
[15:14:42] <vharsh> hmm, To me the mails look confusing
[15:14:42] <sayan> next
[15:14:57] <kushal> Any question?
[15:14:59] <vharsh> I have to look at the time stamps to understand who started the thread, etc
[15:15:10] <rtnpro> vharsh, but don\'t overdo it, as it will make your mail difficult to read
[15:15:22] <vharsh> Please, elaborate the digest mode part,sometime (page#17)
[15:16:02] <rtnpro> vharsh, digest mode means that you get a bunch of mailing list mails (once a week, say) at once
[15:16:20] <kushal> Someone please paste a link to a digest mode reply :)
[15:16:38] <rtnpro> vharsh, it\'s not that useful if you really want to be interactive in a mailing list conversation
[15:16:40] <vharsh> What mistake has happened? Has some user copied the previous email?
[15:17:13] <acetakwas> vharsh::  How do you mean?

[15:17:53] <kushal> moizsajid, not to me, but to vharsh :)
[15:18:01] <moizsajid_> sorry
[15:18:12] <kushal> No need to say sorry :)
[15:18:14] <chandankumar> simple example of digest mode https://paste.fedoraproject.org/382099/66428680/
[15:18:17] <kushal> Anyone else any question?
[15:18:36] <vharsh> kushal, I\'ll need some more time to examine this. I am slow with mails <EOF>
[15:19:02] <pabitra> !
[15:19:05] <vharsh> hmm, it seems 10 mails are delivered as one.
[15:19:21] <kushal> next
[15:19:21] <praveenkumar> pabitra: go ahead with your question.
[15:19:27] <pabitra> went through the digest mail... still not clear
[15:19:46] <pabitra> does it collects only the highlighted texts from each mail ?
[15:20:06] <pabitra> or bunches 10-15 mails in one and delivers it ??
[15:20:07] <Ultimatepritam> moizsajid, he forgot to change the subject line, and so the conversation continued on same thread. Is this a example of Digest mode ?
[15:20:21] <tabrez> kushal,sorry i got late,just came from office
[15:20:32] <kushal> tabrez, no problem
[15:20:58] <lambainsaan> pabitra: Digest Mail means you get one mail in a week, but it is a summary of whatever other people got over the week.
[15:21:13] <SRvSaha> kushal: Is the digest mail randomly selecting some of the mails from the previous mails in a week and sending them at a time.?
[15:21:37] <moizsajid_> Ultimatepritam, I guess so. Can anybody comment on it?
[15:21:48] <kushal> https://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/mailman-admin/node19.html
[15:21:55] <pabitra> same question as of SRvSaha
[15:21:57] <akshays> even i have the same doubt as SRvSaha
[15:22:16] <acetakwas> Digest mode works based on your type of subscription. It is user-specific in a way.
[15:22:23] <yoda__> hi.. sorry iam late
[15:22:41] <sayan> next
[15:22:47] <acetakwas> If you subscribe for mails "per day," then you\'d get batch of emails at the end of each day
[15:22:49] <kushal> basically it is bad.
[15:22:55] <sayan> kushal: +1
[15:22:56] <acetakwas> That is if there are any emails for that day
[15:23:15] <sayan> No more questions?
[15:23:16] <kushal> acetakwas, Thanks for the explanation :)
[15:23:18] <SRvSaha> acetakwas: +1
[15:23:19] <indiabhi> hi got late as well, read the conversation.
[15:23:20] <indiabhi> !
[15:23:24] <sayan> next
[15:23:33] <acetakwas> However, if you subscribe for a week or some other time frame, then the batches would come after that time
[15:23:36] <indiabhi> what does mailman does?
[15:23:48] <kushal> indiabhi, please do not ask questions directly
[15:23:52] <acetakwas> Yes, kushal is right.
[15:23:55] <kushal> indiabhi, type ! and wait for your turn.
[15:24:07] <sayan> indiabhi: https://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/

[15:24:23] <praveenkumar> next
[15:24:23] <sayan> next
[15:24:35] <AndroUser> +1 means ?
[15:24:37] <Ultimatepritam> acetakwas, As when I subscribe to any wordpress blogs there I can see some Delivery Frequency options
[15:24:50] <sayan> AndroUser: I support you on that comment
[15:24:50] <praveenkumar> AndroUser: you agree on someone\'s point.
[15:25:13] <AndroUser> thanks

[15:25:51] PrashantJ_ is now known as PrashantJ
[15:25:55] <indiabhi> !
[15:25:59] <yoda__> what is the topic for today\'s class?
[15:26:05] <acetakwas> That means you want the blog/site to send you periodic emails about their service/product
[15:26:23] <acetakwas> You usually don\'t reply to such emails
[15:26:33] <sayan> yoda__: primarily Q/A on the communication guidelines
[15:26:55] <acetakwas> yoda__::  Mostly, question and answers so far.
[15:27:04] <yoda__> !
[15:27:14] <praveenkumar> next
[15:27:19] <sayan> yoda__: communication is one of the important foundation in open source
[15:27:22] <sayan> next
[15:27:31] <srinidhir> !
[15:27:34] <sayan> next
[15:27:37] <abstatic> What is "GPG-signed email that comes with header/footer" ?
[15:27:49] <indiabhi> I guess my college uses mailman, so we had a problem in which there was a trouble relating to storage space, basically it creates another attachment everytime user sends another email how does gmail and other mail services handles it?
[15:28:12] <praveenkumar> abstatic: https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/x135.html
[15:28:14] <Ultimatepritam> acetakwas, Thank you. I think I understood. :)
[15:28:16] iKshitij is now known as Guest30131
[15:28:51] <yoda__> can you elaborate why communication is so important in open source?
[15:29:08] <acetakwas> Ultimatepritam::  :)
[15:29:24] <sayan> indiabhi: scaling the storage server!?
[15:29:49] <Ultimatepritam> yoda__ : because OpenSource is a Community of free minded people.
[15:29:58] <snarwade> yoda__, communication is important because open source is driven by community
[15:30:04] <sdas> yoda__: communication is important everywhere...that\'s how people will understand and will help you
[15:30:17] <rahuldecoded_> yoda__ developing is not one hand task. that\'s why we need to communicate. In open source we reach people through out the globe
[15:30:36] <sayan> yoda__: so primary we communicate via IRC/Mailing list so you need to follow the guidelines so that the person you are communicating to understands
[15:30:39] <praveenkumar> yoda__: 1. if you don\'t communicate then nobody will know about your work. 2. you might endup wasting lot of time for a problem which is already solved
[15:30:55] <sayan> next
[15:30:59] <srinidhir> Can we get the schedule of topics covered, it would really help pre class prep!
[15:31:09] <indiabhi> sayan, probably using some data structure to keep track of different attachments sent to multiple user and storing it in just one place rather than duplicating it.
[15:31:10] <abhishekcs10> !
[15:31:21] <kushal> srinidhir, Nope, as it is still difficult for us to make that.
[15:31:26] <acetakwas> yoda__:: Communication allows people working on a project to understand themselves.
[15:31:41] <indiabhi> anyways mailman came to my mind, will go through their doc and visit there irc for further discussion :0
[15:31:53] <praveenkumar> next
[15:31:54] <yoda__> i got it.
[15:31:57] <abhishekcs10> how do we use Wiki for documentation...??
[15:32:07] <acetakwas> yoda__::  You can communicate via IRC (like this), mailing list, Slack or more channels.
[15:32:22] <Anandprakash_> Hi,can anyone please tell me how to join summer training
[15:32:27] <kushal> abhishekcs10, You write things in a wiki, and others will read it.
[15:32:31] <kushal> That is how.
[15:32:37] <prashaant> Anandprakash_, fill the google form on dgplug.org
[15:32:40] <kushal> Anandprakash_, you are in the training.
[15:32:48] <Anandprakash_> I have filled

[15:33:04] <Anandprakash_> okay
[15:33:05] <rahuldecoded_> *IT
[15:34:08] <abhishekcs10> one should prefer Wiki or blog for their projects...??
[15:34:18] <moizsajid_> !
[15:34:27] <acetakwas> abhishekcs10::  Both (it depends)
[15:34:49] <acetakwas> abhishekcs10::  Your blog mostly would be edited by you alone
[15:34:58] <punarvasu510> next
[15:35:09] <punarvasu510> sorry!
[15:35:10] <acetakwas> But a wiki allows more people to collaboratively edit a document
[15:35:26] <abhishekcs10> +1 acetakwas
[15:35:29] <yoda__> !
[15:35:34] <abhishekcs10> thank you...:)
[15:35:48] <shauryak_3> !

[15:35:54] <moizsajid_> Is wiki documentation for end users or for developers?
[15:36:02] <sayan> moizsajid_: both
[15:36:43] <chandankumar> moizsajid, sometimes wiki is used as a white board to share their ideas about the project.
[15:37:13] <moizsajid_> got it!
[15:37:15] <sayan> moizsajid_: developers can have documentation, READMEs as wiki
[15:37:42] <yoda__> is there any doc or blog related to today\'s class?
[15:37:43] <sayan> moizsajid_: maybe those developers also create pages for end users too
[15:37:47] <sayan> next
[15:38:11] <sayan> yoda__: doc? as in?
[15:38:20] <SRvSaha> !
[15:38:20] <SRvSaha> How is Wiki different from Documentation?
[15:38:37] <sayan> next
[15:38:42] <yoda__> Documentation for any software which open source community use
[15:38:42] <shauryak_3> can someone give me an example of how they used a blog for their project? a link perhaps?
[15:39:40] <praveenkumar> shauryak_3: http://wiki.libvirt.org/page/Main_Page
[15:39:42] <ShaswataD> http://www.slimframework.com/blog/
[15:39:44] <yoda__> How a communication tool works.A general idea which one can go through
[15:40:06] <abhishekcs10> !
[15:40:10] <chandankumar> shauryak_3, like rtnpro uses his blog to talk about his project http://www.rtnpro.com/ircb-0-1-1-released/

[15:40:59] <abhishekcs10> How we use laTex for documentation...?
[15:41:06] <SRvSaha> How is Wiki different from Documentation?
[15:41:21] <kushal> abhishekcs10, It is a big thing.
[15:41:27] <kushal> abhishekcs10, Takes time to learn
[15:41:35] <abhishekcs10> is it used in wiki as well..?
[15:41:37] <yASH_> !
[15:41:48] <sayan> Documentation is a generic term
[15:41:51] <lambainsaan> SRvSaha: Wiki answers questions like what is the coding standards that is used in the project while documentation give you the functions present in the framework. Not sure.
[15:42:09] <tejasgadsing> !
[15:42:21] <AndroUser> !
[15:42:23] <acetakwas> sayan::  +1
[15:42:59] <SRvSaha> sayan: Ok. Documentation is the Abstract thing that is made up of wikis, blogs <eof>
[15:42:59] <punarvasu510> SRvSaha Wiki is used for documentation
[15:43:04] <rahuldecoded_> !
[15:43:09] <sayan> Documentation is docs related to a software on how to use it? Installation etc
[15:43:22] <sayan> where wiki is a website maintained by a communnity
[15:43:28] <priyanka> <eof>==?
[15:43:30] <sayan> s/where/whereas
[15:43:31] <acetakwas> In my opinion, "Documentation" is a more formal/official release.
[15:43:32] <sayan> next
[15:43:35] <yASH_> Do I have to use blowfish encryption for this ? Because I heard passwords sent through Nickserv and Chanserv are not encrypted if your connection is not encrypted
[15:44:06] <acetakwas> As a developer you want to check the documentation for technical specifications.
[15:44:17] <moizsajid_> yASH_, good question
[15:44:19] <tabrez> sayan, what is s/where
[15:44:36] <yASH_> Thanks !!

[15:46:01] <abhishekg5_> tabrez, it is used to correct anything you previously wrote wrong
[15:46:06] <acetakwas> AndroUser::  No.
[15:46:10] <CuriousLearner> AndroUser, it depends.
[15:46:11] <praveenkumar> AndroUser: depend on how much you already know about that project.
[15:46:15] <sayan> AndroUser: use ! to ask questions
[15:46:18] <sayan> next
[15:46:19] <rahuldecoded_> respond Inline in email. Should we reply inline the opening thread where Question is asked or we can reply to the responded mail too?

[15:46:56] <tabrez> thanks abhishekg5
[15:47:04] <CuriousLearner> rahuldecoded_, you can respond to any mail. You keep the response inline so that it would be easy to track in what context a reply has been made.
[15:47:05] <praveenkumar> rahuldecoded_: It means you should reply inline to whatever question/query/suggestion you want to make against.

[15:48:13] <ashim> for higher security purpose

[15:48:40] <sayan> punarvasu510: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=what+is+encryption+needed
[15:49:41] <sayan> yoda__: you need to be specific. which area of communicating?
[15:49:42] <arthar360_> sayan:
[15:49:45] <acetakwas> yoda__::  Not sure what you mean. A framework is some code written by someone (even you) which you can usually build an app around.
[15:50:04] <acetakwas> It\'s a like "skeletal" code.
[15:50:34] <sayan> yoda__: if you are looking for wiki engines - https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonWikiEngines
[15:50:40] * chandankumar will connect from home.
[15:51:13] <sayan> yoda__: if you are looking for Python IRC bouncers - github.com/waartaa/ircb

[15:51:36] <SRvSaha> !
[15:51:39] <yoda__> someone shared the link the link for slime framework which is wriiten in php.I was curious if there is any such framework built in python
[15:51:55] <sayan> Anandprakash_: you can use a debugger like ipdb or pudb
[15:51:56] abhishekg5__ is now known as abhishekg5
[15:52:27] <Anandprakash_> yes I am using it, what about pycallgraph, I want to explore it more..is it a good idea
[15:52:32] <CuriousLearner> yoda__, there are many like web2py, flask, django, tornado etc.
[15:52:35] <SRvSaha> sayan: Is framework the basic thing, on the top of which we can build something. How is it different from an API then?
[15:52:56] <sayan> yoda__: http://flask.pocoo.org/ something that can be compared to slim
[15:52:59] <indiabhi> yoda__, for writing rest apis Django rest framework is good.
[15:53:07] <tabrez> !
[15:53:17] <kushal> We are moving out too much.
[15:53:18] <sayan> next
[15:53:22] <sanketdg> yoda__: PHP and python are fundamentally different languages. As for web frameworks https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python#web-frameworks
[15:53:24] <sharique> can we consider README for a project on git sites as a documentation ?
[15:53:32] <kushal> No more python questions.
[15:53:42] <praveenkumar> sharique: depend on how good that written
[15:53:46] <ashim> !

[15:54:45] <tabrez> sayan, wiki engines means search engines used to search any doc or related material?
[15:54:52] <kushal> SRvSaha, it is not part of the discussion.
[15:54:58] <thisisashwani> SRvSaha: api is there so as to easy your way to use some other application, while building your own!

[16:02:19] <ashim> mera to janek man nhi krra jbse ye dialog box open hua
[16:02:21] <acetakwas> SRvSaha::  GNU is the operating system. Linux is a kernel. (I\'ll leave you to learn what a Kernel is.)
[16:02:24] <SRvSaha> What is Linux generally referred to as GNU/Linux?
[16:02:25] <manjaroi3_> Linux is simply a kernel. To make it a complete operating system gnu utilities and many other software are required. therefore GNU/Linux
[16:02:33] <chshbh> SRvsaha: because, linux is just a kernel, not the whole operating system, which includes contribution from many, so GNU/Linux signifies the whole os.
[16:02:44] <sayan> .link question

[16:05:47] <kushal> punarvasu510, What do you think are we doing?
[16:06:00] <kushal> Discussing the home task.
[16:06:08] <kushal> That is the difference.
[16:06:10] <kushal> next
[16:06:13] <shobhitupadhyay> which communication create more impact and beneficial,voice or chat communication?
[16:06:56] <acetakwas> shobhitupadhyay::  I think you should stick with what works best for you.
[16:07:00] <prashaant> shobhitupadhyay, both are use  in different scenarios
[16:07:09] <anushil051> email
[16:07:46] <prashaant> shobhitupadhyay, communication = right toot + right time + right people + right job read shaktimaan\'s slides

[16:08:51] <kushal> next
[16:08:54] <abk> there are some non-free distribution of linux, how are they different? i have googled it only to find about some extra driver support.

[16:09:17] <shobhitupadhyay> +1 acetakwas
[16:10:01] <priyanka> prashaant, +1
[16:10:24] <indiabhi> !
[16:10:38] <acetakwas> abk::  Mostly that they are owned by companies that offer technical support
[16:10:50] <kushal> Yes, many hardware does not have open source driver.
[16:11:15] <abk> ok :) so its just about the support. thanks
[16:11:45] <sandeepkr> abk, because they contain software that is not free/libre.Interestingly it turns out to be drivers on most occasions.
[16:12:42] <D1mz> even some multimedia codecs like mp3 are not free software
[16:13:08] <sandeepkr> D1mz, good point.
[16:13:47] <vharsh> Rival organizations(AMD vs Nvidea) scared that their competitors will steal their research.
[16:13:48] <kushal> Yes
[16:13:54] <kuldeep> D1mz, "even some multimedia codecs like mp3 are not free software" patent of the codec and implementation are two different things.
[16:13:54] <kushal> we can continue.

[16:15:13] <priyanka> !
[16:15:23] <kushal> iKshitij, because we think it is the best distribution for developers and users.
[16:15:24] <kushal> next

[16:16:04] <kushal> Anandprakash_, not part of this class.
[16:16:05] <kushal> next
[16:16:06] <indiabhi> how do u search inside irc logs? does google crawls irc logs as well? More importantly how do i find relevant information from irc logs?
[16:16:10] <priyanka> Kushal, what are some risks associated with Open Source Software?
[16:16:47] <kushal> indiabhi, Open the log in browser, press Ctrl+f to open the find box
[16:16:49] <acetakwas> indiabhi::  Use your web browser\'s "Find" feature (Ctrl+F)
[16:16:53] <iKshitij> Rahul Can you justify ! How ?
[16:17:08] <kushal> iKshitij, you will learn with time.
[16:17:11] <kushal> next
[16:17:20] <kushal> priyanka, I don\'t know any.
[16:17:26] <pksadiq> On what basis Fedora is considered to be the best for Developers? I have seen Debian GNU/Linux to have more software and community support
[16:17:30] <rahuldecoded_> !
[16:17:40] <kushal> pksadiq, You will learn it with time.
[16:17:41] <kushal> next
[16:17:52] <iKshitij> Kushal and Rahul Thank You.
[16:17:57] <rahuldecoded_> is irc chats are secured?
[16:18:01] <acetakwas> priyanka::  You could become popular :)
[16:18:07] <sayan> iKshitij: because Fedora works closely with Upstream, has updated packages, you get the latest things on Fedora
[16:18:08] <kuldeep> priyanka, "risks associated..." very broad
[16:18:13] <vharsh> priyanka, Check https://fedoramagazine.org/open-source-black-boxes-radioactivity/
[16:18:21] <chshbh> priyanka: its linear hierarchy can have some disadvantages too.
[16:18:35] <abhishekg5> rahuldecoded_, In what sense ?
[16:18:54] <abhishekcs10> next
[16:18:54] <priyanka> vharsh, okay.
[16:19:02] <acetakwas> rahuldecoded_::  Simply, "No." It\'s in plain text.

[16:19:22] <priyanka> chshbh, okay.
[16:19:39] <kushal> Okay
[16:19:57] <priyanka> acetakwas, means?
[16:20:08] <acetakwas> priyanka::  That\'s a joke.
[16:20:15] <D1mz> priyanka, AFAIK there are only 2 major distros that offer bleeding edge software, Arch and Fedora. Arch is not for beginners so Fedora is a better choice.
[16:20:16] <kushal> next
[16:20:36] <chshbh> +1
[16:20:44] <priyanka> acetakwas,  ohh.
[16:20:58] <kushal> Next
[16:21:07] <kushal> For tomorrow read this https://dgplug.org/irclogs/mbuf_2ndclass.log
[16:21:11] <kushal> Ooops
[16:21:14] <kushal> wrong link
[16:21:18] <sandeepkr> D1mz, how can you say that arch is not for beginners? im not saying you are wrong im just looking for your reason
[16:21:25] <kuldeep> onething that distinquish Arch and Fedora, Arch is rolling release. `pacman -Syu` and you have all the latest packages
[16:21:43] <kushal> For tomorrow please go through https://dgplug.org/irclogs/mbuf_2ndclass.log
[16:21:47] <kushal> Eeks

[16:22:08] <kushal> ^^ read this for tomorrow.
[16:22:09] <kuldeep> with Fedora, one has replace the current with "new release"
[16:22:32] <priyanka> D1mz,  will you explain?
[16:23:07] <sanketdg> kuldeep: Arch definitely takes a lot of setup, whereas Fedora\'s installation and setup is a breeze compared to that.
[16:23:36] <sanketdg> sandeepkr: ^
[16:23:55] <D1mz> sandeepkr, The difficulty in installation and troubleshooting. This is because every installation is unique and the same solution may not work for everyone
[16:24:43] <acetakwas> When you look at so many tools online, and measure how much support they have for one OS (e.g Fedora vs Arch), you would usually find more of Fedora
[16:24:53] <D1mz> Arch has more chances of breaking when upgraded
[16:25:05] <acetakwas> Or Ubuntu (which I use)
[16:25:30] <abstatic> Ubuntu packages very old software
[16:25:47] <acetakwas> So, with Arch, you have less people holding your hands to guid you.

[16:26:01] <thisisashwani> kushal: any other readings for tomorrow?
[16:26:12] <iKshitij> kushal log of Jul 17 2013  ?
[16:26:26] <rahuldecoded_> kushal I think the above link is above. So should we install python?
[16:26:28] <D1mz> No Arch has the top notch documentation of all distros
[16:26:31] <prashaant> everyone , don\'t get sentimental about which distro to use instead focus on the contribution part initially
[16:26:42] <D1mz> +1
[16:26:44] <kuldeep> Arch wiki is one place to get all info its awwsome. and afair there is a fork of Arch in which they are working for "beginners"
[16:26:48] <rahuldecoded_> kushal I think the above link is about python. So should we install python?
[16:26:55] <sayan> Read the link kushal gave
[16:26:56] <chshbh> +1
[16:27:01] <abstatic> +1 kuldeep D1mz
[16:27:04] <vharsh> rahuldecoded_, python is there in most distros
[16:27:05] <rahuldecoded_> sayan ok
[16:27:09] <priyanka> +1 prashaant
[16:27:18] <sayan> And tomorrow you would require a Linux distro
[16:27:25] <android> !
[16:27:30] <sayan> so get it ready those who have not yet
[16:27:31] <sayan> next
[16:27:34] <punarvasu510> Once we type "!", is there any way to get out of the queue?
[16:27:35] <sayan> next
[16:27:58] <sandy_> !
[16:27:59] <sayan> punarvasu510: no, maybe you can send a PR, first contribution :)
[16:28:01] <sayan> next
[16:28:01] <android> how to contribute in open source as a beginner
[16:28:07] <vharsh> !
[16:28:17] <sandy_> what is best to dual boot or installon virtual
[16:28:28] <sayan> android: you will learn that here itself
[16:28:30] <sayan> next
[16:28:34] <anushil051> sandy_ dual boot
[16:28:36] <vharsh> How about recommending a documentary/movie related to linux/etc etc?
[16:28:41] <abstatic> sandy_ setting up dual boot is tricky. you might lose your data
[16:28:44] <rohan_h> android, https://sayanchowdhury.dgplug.org/how-to-get-started-with-open-source/
[16:28:46] <vharsh> I know one of them, Revolution OS
[16:28:53] <grepRoot> +1
[16:29:15] <sayan> sandy_:  it good to get Linux install by somebody who knows if you are not that confident
[16:29:23] <grepRoot> You will get to know the FSF and open source debate.
[16:29:27] <sayan> else go for virtual installation
[16:29:27] <sandy_>  abstatic so what method should i prefer?
[16:29:28] <sandeepkr> vharsh, i guess thats the only one.I might be wrong.
[16:29:29] <ShaswataD> vharsh, Aaron Swartz : Internets Own Boy
[16:29:55] <sayan> vharsh: google, plenty out there
[16:30:02] <grepRoot> +1, though you would mostly learn about aaron\'s life..
[16:30:05] <vharsh> sandeepkr, There\'s one more "Code story linux", "Code rush" -> Mozilla
[16:30:06] <kuldeep> vharsh, RMS talks and gnu.org are useful to understand in broader view
[16:30:12] <gkadam> vharsh, Person of Interest or Mr. Robot
[16:30:20] <mayurparik> what about installing dual boot, UEFI and Legacy
[16:30:21] <vharsh> Please recommend us some.
[16:30:21] <abstatic> sandy_ try installing on a vm first. if you feel comfortable then try dual boot. level of difficulty depends on the other os win7 < win8 < win10
[16:30:48] <sandeepkr> +1 kuldeep
[16:30:51] <sayan> next
[16:30:58] <vharsh> mayurparik, Plenty of videos on youtube.
[16:31:02] <sandy_> sayan: ther is no nobody in my circle who know, first i try to install ubuntu but can\'t
[16:31:31] <grepRoot> gkadam, +1 for POI but that is fiction but good for motivation.
[16:31:57] <indiabhi> haha Machine :p
[16:31:59] <chshbh> sandy_ : try Ubuntu on VMware, plenty of tutorials on how-to
[16:32:15] <gkadam> mayurparik, you need to check if uefi is enabled, or legacy support is enabled. by default uefi will support GPT partition , so you need to be aware of GPT, MBR and other things.
[16:32:21] <shauryak_3> sandy_, search on youtube you will find plenty of videos to dual boot
[16:32:22] <pabitrapati> I am not getting what we are  discussing  on vharsh\'s question
[16:32:32] <abk> youtube shows exactly how to install a linux distro plus google it\'
[16:32:34] <sandy_> sayan: ended changing my all drive  from primary to basic drive ,try create an empty partition but didn\'t work out
[16:32:42] <anushil051> sandy_:it\'s simple just make a bootable and make root,swap,home directory and install
[16:32:52] <pabitrapati>  recommending a documentary/movie related to linux/etc etc
[16:33:07] <gkadam> grepRoot, yes. harold and root are my motivation! :D
[16:33:36] <grepRoot> gkadam: Oh, yeah!
[16:34:06] <grepRoot> is the session over?
[16:34:09] <code_geek> sandy_, to install ubuntu alongside windows, refer to this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FuLXIKLVjg
[16:34:10] <iKshitij> !
[16:34:18] <sandy_> anushil051: i try but when i choose 3rd option it show one c: drive and other all drive combine
[16:34:19] <prashaant> grepRoot, no
[16:34:21] <D1mz> I think persistent live usb is also a good alternative to dual boot
[16:34:26] <iKshitij> Sayan When I was trying to install Fedora dual boot with windows. (Windows PreInstalled). I was getting error " ". I asked the same on fedora forum. They asked me to change Drive to GPT from GMR. what is GPT or GMR
[16:34:46] <abstatic> D1mz, +1  but the OS of choice should be lightweight like puppy or lubuntu
[16:34:50] <sandy_> code_geek: thank\'s  i will see
[16:34:51] * sayan got disconnected
[16:34:59] <mayurparik> +1 iKshitij
[16:34:59] <code_geek> welcome
[16:35:01] <grepRoot> Oh, didn\'t see kushal\'s message for a while. So thought.
[16:35:04] <ShaswataD> !
[16:35:08] <sayan> next
[16:35:12] <sayan> next
[16:35:17] <anushil051> sandy_:first make partition in windows then try you will see every drive
[16:35:18] <sayan> grepRoot: he is disconnected
[16:35:19] <iKshitij> Sayan When I was trying to install Fedora dual boot with windows. (Windows PreInstalled). I was getting error " ". I asked the same on fedora forum. They asked me to change Drive to GPT from GMR. what is GPT or GMR
[16:35:22] <gkadam> iKshitij, it is MBR
[16:35:26] <ShaswataD> is the session over?
[16:35:31] <sayan> iKshitij: let\'s take this question after the sesssion
[16:35:31] <iKshitij> sorry MBR

[15:04:58] <kushal> Questions about FHS/
[15:04:59] <kushal> ?
[15:05:24] <satya4ever> Satyajit Bulage
[15:05:30] <ananthakrishnan> Ananthakrishnan H
[15:05:30] <pabitra> !
[15:05:33] <amitkumarj> FHS??
[15:05:39] <kushal> next
[15:05:46] <pabitra> why library is there in linux
[15:05:48] <D1nz> Dinesh
[15:06:02] <pabitra> if user by mistakely changes any lib file
[15:06:05] <warlord77> amitkumarj, http://www.pathname.com/fhs/pub/fhs-2.3.html
[15:06:11] <pabitra> that might crash the whole system
[15:06:55] <kushal> pabitra, Yes, that is why only root or any other admin can change the /lib content.
[15:07:06] <cosmologist10> !
[15:07:12] <anushil051> !
[15:07:17] <pabitra> yes,... even an user can log in as root and change it
[15:07:36] <pabitra> but as in case of windows the library files are either encrypted or hidden
[15:07:52] <Richard99> mostly hiden
[15:07:57] <Richard99> *hidden
[15:07:59] <kushal> pabitra, You can search about shared libraries to understand more.
[15:08:08] <juggernaut451> ashutosh kumar singh
[15:08:12] <pabitra> so from security prospective i guess exposeure of lib to users is nt safe
[15:08:19] <pabitra> ok.. thanks
[15:08:35] <kushal> pabitra, As root you have to be very careful
[15:08:40] <kushal> pabitra, That is why only a very few people get sudo/root access.
[15:08:41] <kushal> next
[15:08:44] <cosmologist10> Why mercurial is made if we had git already available and difference between git and mercural?
[15:08:57] <cosmologist10> mercurial*
[15:09:22] <kushal> cosmologist10, The same reason why there is Audi and Ferrari.
[15:09:22] <fhackdroid> roll call: Farhaan Buhksh
[15:09:23] <warlord77> !
[15:09:29] <rahuldecoded_> pabitra "Great Power come with great responsibilities"
[15:09:34] <himanshutechy> !
[15:09:39] <dhritishikhar> Dhriti Shikhar
[15:09:39] <kushal> cosmologist10, For the second part of the question use google.com
[15:09:40] <kushal> next
[15:09:43] <anushil051> exactly what does it means by variable data files???
[15:09:54] <priyanka> cosmologist10,  what is mercurial and git?
[15:10:04] <warlord77> What is the benefit of mercurial/bitbucket over git ?
[15:10:06] <kushal> anushil051, Things which can change when a program runs.
[15:10:17] <rahul_bajaj> priyanka, these are version control systems.
[15:10:20] <aman935> !
[15:10:26] <kushal> warlord77, You are asking questions when you are not supposed to.
[15:10:35] <kushal> warlord77, Also ask the same to google.com
[15:10:55] <priyanka> rahul_bajaj, thankyou
[15:10:57] <thisisashwani> cosmologist10: and btw mercurial came before github! :P
[15:11:02] <kushal> warlord77, even before that read the how to ask smart questions article"
[15:11:02] <iyogeshjoshi> priyanka: mercurial and git are version control system, for more detail use google
[15:11:03] <kushal> next
[15:11:04] <warlord77> kushal, sorry yup i will  do that
[15:11:13] <kushal> next
[15:11:18] <himanshutechy> it is always good to learn new technologies but
[15:11:27] <kushal> but?
[15:11:29] <priyanka> iyogeshjoshi,  thanks.
[15:11:36] <himanshutechy> python isa very effective way of doing things
[15:12:02] <kushal> himanshutechy, Python programming language is old.
[15:12:02] <himanshutechy> but if we talk about the market what can anyone expect in india
[15:12:07] <kushal> himanshutechy, started in 1991 iirc/.
[15:12:19] <rahul_bajaj> thisisashwani, you meant mercurial came before git, not github. git and github are two different things.
[15:12:32] <iyogeshjoshi> rahul_bajaj: +1
[15:12:33] <kushal> himanshutechy, not a question for this session, please ask after the class.

[15:13:02] <kushal> aman935, ?
[15:13:07] <aman935> We were going to discuss the article how to teach yourself programming in 10 years, and shell commands. Why are FHS and mercurial being discussed. Were they also part of the homework?
[15:13:14] <SRvSaha> !
[15:13:18] <himanshutechy> ok thanks

[15:14:26] <D1mz> aman935, fhs is also part of home work
[15:14:34] <code_geek> aman935, FHS was but mercurial wasn\'t
[15:14:37] <abstatic> FHS was given as homework
[15:14:42] <sandeepmaity09> Sorry I\'m Late . Sandeep Maity
[15:14:54] <kushal> The other day I said not to give +1, I think people do not care about what I am talking here.

[15:19:48] <code_geek> The new standard is that /media is where the system mounts removable media, and /mnt is for you to mount things manually.
[15:20:25] <kushal> avik, /mnt is mostly used other harddrives in your computer, /media is supposed to be for removable drives, like usb drive, or CD/DVD
[15:20:51] <kushal> avik, in modern Fedora systems it actually uses /run/media
[15:20:53] <kushal> next
[15:21:12] <pabitra> are /etc and /opt related or linked
[15:21:21] <pabitra> because one contains config files
[15:21:24] <avik> ok now its better :) thank you code_geek , kushal
[15:21:30] <pabitra> where as the other is software
[15:21:35] <kushal> pabitra, No.
[15:21:52] <kushal> pabitra, It can happen that the software in /opt has its configs on /opt itself
[15:22:00] <himanshutechy> !
[15:22:04] <pabitra> and then what config files re present in /etc ??
[15:22:28] <pabitra> oh.. i thought whatever software we install that will be placed in opt but ints config will
[15:22:33] <pabitra> be in /etc
[15:22:48] <kushal> pabitra, nope, /opt is used for special cases.
[15:23:02] <pabitra> I guess, my assumption was wrong then
[15:23:12] <kushal> pabitra, for the software which does not come properly packaged by the operating system etc cases.
[15:23:12] <pabitra> special case ??
[15:23:20] <pabitra> not for all software ??
[15:23:31] <kushal> no.
[15:23:32] <kushal> next
[15:23:34] <vbhjain> I\'m asking question from norvig peter\'s blog : what is the language Standardization ? why is it said : " Have the good sense to get off the language standardization effort as quickly as possible "?
[15:24:13] <kushal> vbhjain, Have you typed that question in google.com?
[15:24:23] <Richard99> !
[15:24:55] <akahat> Roll Call; Amol Kahat
[15:25:07] <vbhjain> ya but it prompted different things.....
[15:25:08] <anushil051> !
[15:25:10] <pabitra> !
[15:26:16] <abstatic> !
[15:26:21] <Richard99> i just started learning python basics and i will get the best of it as soon as i can....will there be any problem attending the classes
[15:26:40] <Richard99> sorry for that!!

[15:27:05] <SRvSaha> Regarding execution of a binary file execution : Say I have a test.c file in my hard disk. After moving to that directory, if using gcc and try to run the binary file "a.out" it says perission denied. Even after changing the permission using chmod +x a.out , why is it unable to run the binary file from that dir?? But the same does not happen when the same is done from /home/<username>. Why is Linux system not giving permissions for executing from other har
[15:27:08] <SRvSaha> d disks??
[15:27:16] <SRvSaha> <eof>
[15:28:12] <kushal> vbhjain, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language_specification
[15:28:34] <mhalano> SRvSaha: Maybe you should link the a.out to generate a useful binary. imho
[15:28:43] <abstatic> SRvSaha, it could be because the other partition from where you are trying to execute the file is not ext4. if it is NTFS/FAT then it does not have any concept of file permissions/ownerships
[15:28:45] <mhalano> gcc -o test test.c
[15:28:48] <avik> !
[15:28:49] <vbhjain> kushal,ok
[15:29:11] <kushal> next
[15:29:14] <LambaInsaan> In /bin, /usr/bin, /usr/local/bin,  /bin is local to root, /usr/local/bin is local to a user, if I am correct about the first two parts, what is usr/bin/ local to?
[15:29:21] <SRvSaha> abstatic: Ok got it. Yes, it is NTFS indeed.
[15:29:51] <snarwade> LambaInsaan, /usr/sbin is of root
[15:30:38] <snarwade> LambaInsaan, /usr/bin is of normal user
[15:30:49] <mhalano> LambaInsaan: /bin is for user binaries installed with the basic system. /usr/bin is for binaries of no essential applications
[15:31:37] <mhalano> LambaInsaan: /usr/local/bin is for binaries installed without a package, like when you compile and install from source, or create a script to all users.
[15:33:07] <LambaInsaan> Okay, thank you. mhalano, snarwade.
[15:33:23] <mhalano> LambaInsaan: /sbin, /usr/sbin and /usr/local/sbin are the same, but for binaries root-only
[15:33:48] <priyanka> !
[15:34:19] <LambaInsaan> The different levels in the tree is not because of user restrictions?
[15:34:36] <kushal> next
[15:34:50] <abk1> i understood this difference but how can i switch over? <root@abk:~#>< root@abk:/# >
[15:35:15] <snarwade> abk1, cd /
[15:35:34] <abk1> oh thanks
[15:35:38] <abk1> got it
[15:35:56] <kushal> next
[15:35:58] <himanshutechy> debain based distribution would work fine in the class?
[15:36:25] <LambaInsaan> Got it! <EOF>
[15:37:02] <abhishekg5> himanshutechy, yes
[15:37:53] <himanshutechy> thanks abhishekg5
[15:38:04] <kushal> next
[15:38:06] <Richard99> i just started learning python basics and i will get the best of it as soon as i can....will there be any problem attending the classes
[15:39:05] <kushal> Richard99, we are not teaching Python now.
[15:40:03] <Richard99> i know that...but this worries me
[15:40:15] <kushal> next
[15:40:18] <anushil05> can u tell about /srv I didn\'t understand
[15:40:28] <kushal> anushil05, what is u?
[15:40:37] <anushil05> anushil051
[15:40:50] <rahuldecoded_> "You" :)
[15:41:02] <rahul_bajaj> Richard99, it would be great if you used only one "." :D
[15:41:23] <Richard99> rahul_bajaj thank you
[15:41:39] <anushil05> Actually light is gone I am using from my phone
[15:42:09] <chshbh> Richard99 : python is not a prerequisite for this training, don\'t worry everyone will start from the beginning. :)
[15:42:13] <kushal> anushil05, That directory contains files for some specific services (basics special applications, like ftp and others).
[15:42:25] <Richard99> chshbh :)
[15:42:30] <kushal> next
[15:42:33] <pabitra> there are /bin folder as well as /usr/bin, /usr/locale/bin??? why such duplicacy of bin
[15:43:14] <snarwade> pabitra, these are not duplicates
[15:43:27] <pabitra> yes. not duplicate..
[15:43:35] <pabitra> duplicate might be improper..
[15:43:47] <pabitra> what i meant was why there are so many bins
[15:44:06] <pabitra> can\'t a single bin can server the purpose
[15:44:08] <pabitra> ??
[15:44:18] <kushal> pabitra, because we keep different commands in different places, and it comes from old unix philosophy
[15:44:20] <kushal> next
[15:44:24] <abstatic> when we say /usr , /usr/bin directories, so the content in these are accessible by every user in the system ? and why are all the files owned by root user even in these directories ?
[15:45:13] <abstatic> should it not be owned by the user who installed the binary file or package ?
[15:45:35] <kushal> abstatic, so that no one can randomly change the things in those directories, and there can be more than one user in a computer.
[15:45:36] <akshays> !
[15:46:08] <ak_d> abstatic: root user has access to every file
[15:46:13] <kushal> next
[15:46:19] <kushal> next
[15:46:26] <priyanka> What is a binary file?
[15:46:36] <avik_> why can i not access sda or sda1 or  sda2?  {" cd sda"  shows "sda not a directory" }
[15:46:53] <kushal> pritam, Did you google that question?
[15:46:54] <amitk_> priyanka same like exe in windows
[15:46:56] <rahuldecoded_> priyanka "use google first".
[15:47:38] <aman_> !
[15:47:43] <kushal> avik_, In linux everything comes as a file, so your second partition comes as /dev/sda2 file, you have to mount it (if not done already) on say /mnt, and then view /mnt
[15:47:55] <kushal> avik, you will learn it in the coming days.
[15:47:55] <kushal> next
[15:47:56] <vbhjain> avik_,sda is a disk partition you have to mount it to access it
[15:47:59] <akshays> why is that we have /lib and /usr/lib ? when i do ls in both i can see all same files in both of them.
[15:48:00] <priyanka> Oh, thanks amitk_, rahuldecoded_.
[15:48:04] <mhalano> abstatic: every user can read the binary and execute the command, but only root can change the binary (like remove) and some commands only work for root.
[15:48:23] <kushal> akshays, It modern systems the both are same.
[15:48:28] <kushal> next
[15:48:31] <avik> ok understood guys thank you
[15:49:37] <thisisashwani> !
[15:50:08] <abhishekg5> guys it would be good if we use google first for questions starting with \'what is...\' and then ask doubts if we don\'t understand something. This way we can benefit maximum from the training
[15:50:24] <aman_> as .bat file in window...what is the language use to create .bat or command files in any os
[15:50:43] <kushal> aman_, you will learn it today :)
[15:51:04] <code_geek> !
[15:51:22] <aman_> kushal: thanks

[15:52:48] HoloIRCUser4 is now known as Rohith
[15:52:51] <kushal> next
[15:53:00] <code_geek> Query solved :)
[15:53:09] <thisisashwani> kushal: then why do we have /lib and /usr/lib if both are same? is it so because old unix systems used to have such hierarchy?
[15:53:20] <kushal> thisisashwani, Yes, correct
[15:53:22] <poonam> !
[15:53:33] <kushal> next
[15:53:33] <kushal> next
[15:54:08] <rahuldecoded_> !
[15:54:34] <priyanka> abhishekg5, i agree with you, i am a beginner hence there are many terms i am not getting in classes, so google it will take much time...so i think asking right now is better
[15:54:35] <poonam> it is given that sbin -- non essential sys admin commands, then what else it contains
[15:55:00] <kushal> next
[15:55:03] <rahuldecoded_> as a root user [root@localhost /]# cd root switches to [root@localhost ~]# but in case [rahuldecoded@localhost /]$ cd root  it give    -bash: cd: root: Permission denied why ?
[15:55:26] <kushal> rahuldecoded, Because a normal user can not access /root
[15:55:51] <Anandprakash> !
[15:55:59] <kushal> next
[15:56:19] <kushal> Okay
[15:56:41] <kushal> To learn bash commands properly start reading from http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/Bash-Beginners-Guide.pdf
[15:56:42] <Anandprakash> Please tell me some important commands related to internet apart from ping,telnet,netstat?
[15:56:56] <pabitra> rahuldecoded_, in first you are trying as a root user, but in second you are trying to access from a normal user preveledges
[15:56:59] <kushal> Anandprakash, Read the link
[15:57:29] <rahuldecoded_> thanks kushal pabitra
[15:57:35] <SRvSaha> priyanka: Refer google. That is the best way to learn anything in though asking here will give you a lump-sum idea, you need to google about the topic to know in detail
[15:57:39] <Anandprakash> okay, Kushal
[15:57:49] <mhalano> I need to go now. I will read the logs and do the assignments. bye everyone
[15:57:59] <vbhjain> !
[15:58:04] <pksadiq> https://en.flossmanuals.net/_booki/command-line/command-line.pdf is also good enough
[15:58:31] <priyanka> okay, got it SRvSaha
[15:58:35] <HoloIRCUser4> Can I ask questions related to Android development here?
[15:58:43] <kushal> Start reading the book

[15:14:31] <sayan> oh! Isee
[15:14:37] <thisisashwani> vbhjain: type \'man ls\' without the quotes on any side!
[15:14:51] <CuriousLearner> vbhjain, that\'s secondary prompt, shell expects that you\'ll enter something else to complet the command
[15:15:11] <sayan> vbhjain: so giving \' in the end means that it expecting string
[15:15:24] <sayan> that\'s why you were getting that prompt
[15:15:45] <thisisashwani> okay, i didn\'t know the reason for the prompt. Now I know!
[15:15:56] <vbhjain> CuriousLearner ,sayan : ok
[15:16:03] <sayan> something like this https://paste.fedoraproject.org/383696/14666877/
[15:16:16] <sayan> next
[15:16:19] <abstatic> what is the difference between Ctrl +C and ctrl + D in bash
[15:16:40] <priyanka_> what is bash?
[15:16:57] <abstatic> Bourne Again SHell.
[15:16:57] <thisisashwani> priyanka_: http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/Bash-Beginners-Guide.pdf
[15:17:03] <nikhil07> yup
[15:17:15] <sayan> abstatic: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=what+is+the+difference+between+ctrl%2Bd+and+ctrl%2Bc+in+unix
[15:17:17] <akahat> priyanka_, Bash is command line shell.
[15:17:22] <iKshitij> !
[15:17:50] <priyanka_> thisisashwani,  akahat thank you.
[15:18:44] <sayan> priyanka_: Larry Page and Sergey Brin built a small little website that has everything you can try searching it there :)
[15:18:49] <sayan> next
[15:19:26] <priyanka_> sayan, which website?
[15:19:34] <yASH> Google.com
[15:19:35] <sandeepmaity09> Google
[15:19:36] <nikhil07> google
[15:19:39] <nikhil07> bro
[15:19:55] <nikhil07> oops
[15:19:55] <iKshitij> Sayan I am getting "admin is not in the sudoers file. this incident will be reported" for few commands. What\'s this ?
[15:20:08] <rahul_bajaj> priyanka_, https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/What-is-Bash_003f.html
[15:20:13] <priyanka_> oh, thanks sayan.
[15:20:19] <iKshitij> hahaa small website
[15:20:54] <akahat> iKshitij, You need to add your user in sudoers file.
[15:20:54] <sayan> iKshitij: you must be trying to use sudo with your commands!
[15:20:57] <priyanka_> thanks rahul_bajaj.
[15:21:16] <sayan> iKshitij: add you user to sudoers file.
[15:21:17] <akahat> iKshitij, open /etc/sudoers file using root
[15:21:28] <sayan> akahat: let me google :)
[15:21:32] <skarale> Roll Call: Snehal Karale
[15:21:33] <D1mz> iKshitij, alternatively you can use su
[15:21:49] <sayan> next
[15:21:55] <sayan> No more questions?
[15:22:03] <hemanth> !
[15:22:08] <sayan> next
[15:22:08] <vbhjain> iKshitij, or you can use su to login as root
[15:23:04] <hemanth> sayan can I change this in my command prompt "hemanth@hemanth-Inspiron-3542:~$" to just  hemanth
[15:23:08] <akahat> sayan, ok :)
[15:23:14] <iKshitij> tried but the same line. Thanks everyone I will try again.
[15:23:23] <CuriousLearner> hemanth, that\'s primary prompt referred by PS1
[15:23:26] <sayan> hemanth: yes, you can but I won\'t suggest :)
[15:23:34] <sayan> check for changing PS1 on google
[15:23:44] <sayan> CuriousLearner: +1
[15:23:53] <hemanth> thanks sayan
[15:24:09] <hemanth> thanks CuriousLearner
[15:24:17] <sayan> I have messed up mine several times but it\'s a good learning too :)
[15:24:23] <sayan> Questions?
[15:24:29] <sandeepmaity09> iKshitij, use the command "usermod -aG sudo Your_user_name" to add user in sudoer\'s file
[15:25:03] <yoda_> !
[15:25:11] <sayan> next
[15:25:18] <pksadiq> sandeepmaity09: but there is a circular dependency for running that command :)
[15:25:52] <sayan> pksadiq: why?
[15:26:02] <yoda_> difference between terminal and shell.why shell is such an important topic?how it is related to this training?
[15:26:19] <iKshitij> akahat  "bash: /etc/sudoers: Permission denied"
[15:26:23] <snarwade> sandeepmaity09, wheel group
[15:26:33] <iKshitij> looged in as root
[15:26:36] <sandeepmaity09> pksadiq, then edit the /etc/sudoers file by visudo command
[15:26:37] <pksadiq> sayan: you need to run that command as root.
[15:26:39] <chshbh> Terminal provides sort of GUI to shell, yoda_
[15:26:43] <akahat> iKshitij, open it using root user
[15:27:05] <sayan> yoda_: terminal is just an application
[15:27:10] <rahul_bajaj> yoda_,  for now you can think of it being the same thing.
[15:27:34] <indiabhi> !
[15:27:41] <vbhjain> !
[15:27:51] <yoda_> i.e what i do in terminal is executed in shell
[15:27:55] <D1mz> !
[15:27:55] <yoda_> right?
[15:28:01] <sayan> rahul_bajaj: no the same, they are totally independent component
[15:28:06] <sayan> s/no/not
[15:28:34] <sayan> yoda_: yes
[15:28:38] <sayan> next
[15:28:50] <indiabhi> how is bash different from csh and other shell?
[15:29:00] <CuriousLearner> yoda_, http://askubuntu.com/questions/506510/what-is-the-difference-between-terminal-console-shell-and-command-line
[15:30:12] <sayan> indiabhi: they have different features but with the core purpose same
[15:31:01] <sayan> next
[15:31:22] <vbhjain> what is the difference between usage of " pwd --logical " and " pwd --physical " ?
[15:31:25] <vbhjain> if I see man pwd then it prompts out :
[15:31:25] <vbhjain>  -L, --logical
[15:31:25] <vbhjain>     use PWD from environment, even if it contains symlinks
[15:31:25] <vbhjain>  -P, --physical    avoid all symlinks
[15:31:44] <realslimshanky> !
[15:32:41] <snarwade> vbhjain, symlinks like /usr/bin and /bin
[15:32:56] <indiabhi> !
[15:33:08] <sayan> vbhjain: -p excludes the symlinks
[15:34:02] <sayan> have symlinks been taught?
[15:34:10] <abstatic> no
[15:34:18] <indiabhi> exactly my question?
[15:34:46] <snarwade> sayan, it was discussed yesterday in between these questions
[15:34:51] <sayan> I would then skip that part
[15:35:07] <vbhjain> sayan ,ok
[15:35:45] <sayan> snarwade: I would leave that to the bash session then
[15:35:58] <thisisashwani> !
[15:35:58] <snarwade> sayan, okay
[15:36:01] <sayan> next
[15:36:03] <D1mz> Will we be learning bash scripting as part of this class or will we be learning basics of bash?
[15:37:19] <sayan> D1mz: yes, praveenkumar had to take up the session today but he got busy
[15:37:50] <D1mz> sayan,you mean bash scripting?
[15:38:03] <sayan> D1mz: writing scripts in bash
[15:38:04] <sayan> next
[15:38:12] * sayan is getting way too many calls
[15:38:13] <D1mz> thank you.
[15:38:31] <sayan> next
[15:38:41] <realslimshanky> Hi sayan,it\'s my first day and I\'m new to linux as well. I found iso for Ubuntu so didn\'t waste time on downloading fedora for now. Will there be any session for new users of linux from scratch ?
[15:38:59] <indiabhi> already answered thank you.
[15:39:03] <sayan> realslimshanky: yes, there have been a few sessions, you can check the logs
[15:39:04] <sayan> next
[15:39:12] <thisisashwani> query solved :)
[15:39:18] <sayan> realslimshanky: https://dgplug.org/irclogs/
[15:39:28] <realslimshanky> I\'ll go through them, Thanks batul :)
[15:39:35] <realslimshanky> Thanks sayan :D
[15:39:45] <sayan> next
[15:40:34] <sayan> Questions?
[15:40:46] <chshbh> realslimshanky : batul is a bot
[15:40:49] <himanshutechy> !
[15:40:54] <indiabhi> how does alias work? Does it execute a shell script?
[15:40:55] <sayan> next
[15:41:23] <himanshutechy> when we\'ll start the real coding or real world examples
[15:41:25] <sayan> indiabhi: use ! :)
[15:41:54] <indiabhi> sorry
[15:42:06] <indiabhi> !
[15:42:08] <sayan> himanshutechy: we are already in progress
[15:42:15] <CuriousLearner> next
[15:42:52] <sayan> next
[15:42:58] <indiabhi> how does alias work? Does it execute a shell script?
[15:43:02] <sayan> CuriousLearner: we need to add you to the script
[15:43:13] <CuriousLearner> ah, alright sayan no issues :0
[15:43:58] <snarwade> indiabhi, alias is just your custom command for shell command
[15:44:10] <dgplug> Onkar karale
[15:44:26] <indiabhi> so we can any number of aliases?
[15:44:27] <pksadiq> dgplug: nice nick
[15:44:32] <sayan> indiabhi:  yes
[15:44:34] <snarwade> indiabhi, like you can put alias as \'indiabhi\' for \'ls\'
[15:44:36] <CuriousLearner> indiabhi, yes
[15:44:59] <indiabhi> okay and for more than one command?
[15:45:16] <snarwade> indiabhi, you can put
[15:45:22] <gkadam> indiabhi, you can write &&
[15:45:24] <sayan> indiabhi: suppose you are typing commands with many arguments then you can create a alias
[15:45:42] <gkadam> indiabhi, mkdir test && cd test
[15:45:46] <snarwade> in /etc/profile or in bashrc file
[15:46:23] <gkadam> indiabhi, snarwade , sayan sorry , i thought he is asking for executing multiple commands at a same time
[15:46:50] <indiabhi> yeah got it thanks :)
[15:46:55] <CuriousLearner> okay, more questions?
[15:48:06] <CuriousLearner> anyone need to ask anything?
[15:48:44] <aman-> !
[15:48:48] <sayan> next
[15:48:49] <CuriousLearner> next
[15:48:56] <aman-> how can we made a binary file ?
[15:49:17] <aman-> or any command file on any os ?
[15:49:23] <poonam> !
[15:49:28] <CuriousLearner> aman-, all executable programs are converted to binary
[15:49:48] <sayan> next
[15:49:57] <aman-> !
[15:49:59] <akahat> aman-, you can change permissions
[15:50:03] <poonam> if root is doing alias then will it be applicable to all other user?
[15:50:34] <snarwade> poonam, if you put it in /etc/profile
[15:50:49] <snarwade> other user also can use it poonam
[15:51:32] <hemanth> !
[15:51:58] <sayan> next
[15:52:00] <aman-> there are many .bat or .config file . how can anyone create them ?
[15:52:31] <gkadam> !
[15:52:46] <indiabhi> !
[15:52:48] <CuriousLearner> aman-, bat is used in windows, in linux we have .sh files
[15:53:05] <sayan> aman-: so basically each software have their own set of configs
[15:53:10] <CuriousLearner> config files are used for configuration purpose, created similarly you create other files
[15:53:37] <sayan> you just need to follow the documentation and create the configuration files
[15:53:38] <aman-> but in which language are they created ?
[15:53:51] <CuriousLearner> aman-, depends on type of software
[15:54:02] <aman-> okay ...thanks :)
[15:54:07] <sayan> aman-: there are many markup languages, depends on how the software uses
[15:54:25] <CuriousLearner> aman-, like you can use YAML
[15:54:51] <CuriousLearner> next
[15:54:55] <sayan> next
[15:55:05] <hemanth> can one user get superuser previllege permanently so no need of sudo
[15:55:16] <CuriousLearner> hemanth, you should not do that
[15:55:25] <sayan> hemanth: yes you can
[15:55:31] <abstatic> you can disable asking for password, in the sudoers file whenver you use the sudo command
[15:55:33] <sayan> but as CuriousLearner said you should not
[15:55:41] <CuriousLearner> uplifted privileges are dangerous
[15:55:44] <sayan> abstatic: -1 for that too
[15:55:59] <snarwade> hemanth, it can ruin your life :P
[15:56:00] <sayan> next
[15:56:04] <gkadam> how is .bashrc different from /etc/profile ?
[15:56:23] <hemanth> thanks guys ... :)
[15:57:15] <CuriousLearner> gkadam, google
[15:57:30] <sayan> difficult question to explain :D
[15:57:47] <snarwade> .bashrc is for specific user
[15:57:54] <sayan> .bashrc or .zshrc are generally used to local based configuration
[15:58:18] <sayan> s/local/user
[15:58:41] <sayan> whereas /etc/profile helps settings the variables for all the user shells
[15:58:42] <snarwade>   /etc/profile enables alias for all users
[15:58:56] <mhalano> But there ~/.profile
[15:59:32] <indiabhi> so for global changes and aliases we should put in /etc/profiles right?
[15:59:41] <mhalano> I think ~/.profile is shell independent and ~/.bashrc and ~/.zshrc are shell dependent
[15:59:51] <sayan> see the thing is if it\'s there in /etc it\'s for all users
[16:00:26] <sayan> whereas if you keep it in the home directory it is for a single user
[16:00:58] <snarwade> sayan, +1
[16:00:59] <sayan> suppose my bashrc is in /home/devbox/.bashrc
[16:01:36] <sayan> so this file will be initialized whenever I and starting bash or terminal from the user devbox
[16:01:43] <mhalano> !
[16:02:22] <sayan> this will also have the configuration from /etc/bashrc
[16:02:42] <sayan> but if the same values are repeated in /etc/bashrc and ~/.bashrc
[16:02:51] <sayan> then ~/.bashrc overrides the parent value
[16:02:53] <sayan> next
[16:02:56] <sayan> next
[16:03:00] <mhalano> What is the difference between ~/.profile and ~/.{bash,zsh}rc?
[16:03:07] <gkadam> :D
[16:03:30] <sayan> gkadam: hope that explains :)
[16:03:40] <gkadam> sayan, yes. thanks!
[16:03:41] <indiabhi> good explanation, sayan  thanks :)
[16:04:00] <snarwade> mhalano, I am unable to find ~/.profile :(
[16:04:10] <sayan> mhalano: profile is used generally for setting environment variables like the PS1 I told you
[16:04:22] <sayan> snarwade: if it\'s not there you can create one
[16:04:32] <snarwade> sayan, ok
[16:04:40] <snarwade> thanks
[16:04:47] <sayan> and bashrc are for functions and aliases
[16:04:49] <pksadiq> mhalano: every time the bash (or zsh) shell runs, it executes a file .bashrc (or .zshrc). So configurations related to those shells should be present in corresponding files
[16:05:05] <mhalano> sayan, profile is shell independent?
[16:05:25] <pksadiq> mhalano: ~/.profile (and /etc/profile) may be used by other graphical tools too  (not specific to bsh)
[16:05:27] <sayan> mhalano: no
[16:05:27] <pksadiq> bash*
[16:05:38] <mhalano> I saw ~/bin as a path is declared in ~/.profile
[16:06:16] <sayan> next
[16:06:42] <mhalano> pksadiq, I know. That\'s why I say it is shell independent. Serves for bash, zsh, etc.
[16:06:48] <sayan> Let\'s take the questions related to bashrc/profile after the class
[16:07:12] <mhalano> sayan, ok
[16:07:20] <sayan> So the next class will be posted on mailing list.
